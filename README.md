# The Manual Dev

This is a game created for the [2025 GamedevJS Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gamedevjs-2025)

It is a game made with Phaser and some assets with aseprite :P. 

The theme of the jam was "balance" so, with homer0 (a friend and a faithful suscriber of my twitch channel) thought about create a game about a skate doing manual all the time (we are fans of THPS series lol)
